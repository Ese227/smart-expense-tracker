# SmartExpense Tracker

A full-stack expense tracking web application I built to practise and demonstrate:

- RESTful API design (Node.js + Express)
- User authentication with JWT
- Working with MongoDB via Mongoose
- A React frontend with protected routes and data visualisation

Users can:

- Register and log in
- Add expenses (title, amount, category, date)
- View a list of expenses
- See charts of spending by month and by category
